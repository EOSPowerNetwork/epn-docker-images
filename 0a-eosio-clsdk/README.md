# Intro

This [docker image](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/jamesmart/eosio-clsdk) configures an ubuntu environment with the tools necessary to build eos smart contracts compiled with the clsdk (rather than the cdt by B1).

## How to use

No one really needs to use this repo. Just use the docker image linked above if you want an environment preconfigured for eos with clsdk development.

# Command used to build the docker image

```docker image build -t jamesmart/eosio-clsdk:latest .```
